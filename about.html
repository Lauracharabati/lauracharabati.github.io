<h2 class="h1-responsive font-weight-bold text-center my-5">JADE WILLIAMS</h2>
 <p class="text-center w-responsive mx-auto mb-5"> Hi there! I'm Jade Williams, the owner and creator of Fashion She Loves. I'm a 17 year old girl who has a major passion for photography, fashion and videography. My creative interests were sparked from a young age, taking sewing lessons which led to my interest in fabrics, fashion, design and colour. I would spend hours sketching fashion designs and cutting out different patterns from my design book that I would mix and match together. I also enjoyed taking photos of nature and creating short films, and over the years my photography, videography and editing skills have progressed. Through my skills in digital design, I created Fashion She Loves to express my love of fashion and personal style. 
  </p>
  
            
<h2 class="h1-responsive font-weight-bold text-center my-5">FASHION SHE LOVES</h2>
<p class="text-center w-responsive mx-auto mb-5"> My vision for Fashion She Loves is to reach out to teenage girls who enjoy fashion or who may be struggling to find their personal style and provide them with fashion inspiration and advice. I have written about my favourite fashion brands and places to shop, and included three different inspirational short fashion films, showing my fashion style for different occasions including the beach, a cafe and a picnic. Throughout my blog, I have used different models to share my personal style and the different looks you can create. My blog is feminine, modern, classy, a little edgy and inspirational. </p>
