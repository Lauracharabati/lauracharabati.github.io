Knowing what brands to shop at as a young teenage girl can be very challenging for a lot of girls, as they may begin to loose interest in the brands they shopped at when they were younger and grow out of their clothes. As a 13-14 year old, I was very unsure of where to shop at. I tested and tried out many new fashion brands, and luckily was also able to seek advice from my older sister. My knowledge on fashion brands soon widely progressed as I found a collection of new shops that I enjoyed. From my personal experiences with these brands, fashion brands that I would recommend for young teenage girls to shop at include:
<br>
<strong>
1. Glassons <br>
2. Cotton On <br>
3. Supre <br>
4. Sportsgirl <br>
5. City Beach <br>
6. Seed <br>
7. Ally Fashion <br> 
8. Shein <br>
9. boohoo <br>
10. H&M
</strong> 
<br>
<br>
This outfit worn by Jasmine shown above is pretty, cute and summery, and is very suitable for young teenage girls who like to dress girly. I love this red strapless crop top from City Beach, as it is thin and light and will keep you cool on a warm summer's day. The top lifts the whole look and makes this outfit pop, making it the main stand out piece of this look. She matched this top with a white denim skirt from Seed, as it compliments the top very nicely. The glittery sandals that she is wearing from THE ICONIC add a bit of sparkle to this outfit. For jewellery, Jasmine wore a gold choker and brown tie up bracelet with an elephant charm on it from Sportsgirl.
